PORT w/ Bloomberg (PMS)
AIM w/ Bloomberg
EMS-X w/ Bloomberg

We don't worry about OMS because we only have one fund.

OMS Reqs: Needs to be squeaky clean, needs to avoid front running.


Bloomberg's PMS is worthwhile.

EMS does not track historic trades

Dividends immediately shown although not tradable yet? (Ask Enfusion)

--

Fund admins; which ones do they work with?

Otso if it works out, Dan for sure.

Cash accounts outside trade accounts should be tracked as if they were outside client. We DO need to implement cash accounts.

Our funds are performance fee focused; try to align incentives, make us hurt when the client is hurt.

2yr period where we track alpha, then we take performance fee from oldest quarter, recalculated and drawn in each quarter. This is different from, say, a day-to-day & withdraw if alpha situation.

Virtual shares per client.

Enfusion doesn't offer tracking of virtual client shares.

In most cases, the fund admin will do those calculations. The accounting GL is not meant to be a source of record, it is "shadow functionality".

--

Very important that we get the most recent prices for the sake of automated strategies.

Emerging markets and the nuance here.

We might want to get a list of exchanges from Micah and cross-check it w/ Enfusion.

Cannot pull real-time data via API.

Apparently, there is one-off brokers that might give us better commissions.
The question is whether we integrate with these "one-off" brokers or not.
Ideally, even THESE trades to exotic brokers would be automated.
But it would be costly.

VCSCS is a potential broker.

We have a contract w/ Bloomberg, %15 exit fee of the rest of the value of the contract.
