# Current concerns

- Looks like we have more IB accounts that files...
- We'd need files on all our accounts if we're to reliably pull an as-of view of
our portfolio on a certain date, which is something that we'll absolutely need
for an implementation.
- NT's ftp server is completely empty of files...? Last one that our AIM VM 
saved was in October 2021?
